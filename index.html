<h2>Summary</h2>
<div class="content">
<p> I am a first-year Ph.D. student (2024) in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.uq.edu.au/">University of Queensland</a>. My research focuses on the transferability and generalization of ML models. Before joining UQ, I earned a Master's degree in Computer Engineering (2021-2024) and a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering (2016-2021) from <a href="https://en.sharif.ir/">Sharif University of Technology</a>. With over three years of experience (2021-2024) as business data analyst in the data science department at <a href="https://tapsi.ir/">Tapsi</a>, one of Iran's leading ride-hailing companies, I have applied my expertise in real-world business settings.

<h2>Education</h2>
<div class="content">
<p> My undergraduate studies blended electrical engineering principles with biomedical applications and interdisciplinary knowledge. I explored biological sciences through courses such as Computational Neuroscience, Systems Biology, Bioinformatics, which deepened my understanding of complex biological systems. Concurrently, I developed strong data analysis and programming skills through coursework in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computational Intelligence, Causal Inference, and Advanced Programming. Additionally, courses like Fundamentals of Economics and Project Control provided valuable insights into resource management, planning, and decision-making in technology-driven projects. This diverse education equipped me to address challenges at the intersection of engineering, biology, and data science, with both technical expertise and strategic thinking.
</p>
<br>
<p>
During my master’s program, I specialized in Artificial Intelligence, with coursework in Advanced AI, Statistical Learning, Pattern Recognition, and Neural Networks. My thesis, Enhancing Variance Reduction Methods in Randomized Experiments, focused on improving experimental design and analysis techniques, contributing to more accurate and efficient statistical inference.
</p>
<br>
<p> In my PhD research I am concentrating on enhancing the robustness and generalizability of statistical models, which is crucial for ensuring that these models perform reliably across a variety of untested scenarios.

<h2>Experience</h2>
<div class="content">
<p> In my role as a Business Data Analyst, I contributed over three years to driving product innovation across Matching, Map, and Delivery domains. Leveraging advanced data analytics and technical skills in SQL, Python, and statistics, I extracted actionable insights from large datasets to enable data-driven decision-making. Key accomplishments include designing robust A/B testing frameworks with variance reduction techniques, applying causal inference methods, developing machine learning models, creating ETL pipelines with Apache Airflow, and building interactive dashboards in Tableau to support strategic decisions. My expertise in managing and analyzing big data using PySpark streamlined processes and optimized performance.
</p>
<br>
<p>
I have a teaching background across various institutions, where I’ve focused on bridging theoretical concepts with practical applications. At <a href = "https://become.expert/">Becomexpert</a>, I led a 25-hour internship program, guiding students through real-world data science projects. I involved in teaching a graduate course in Pattern Recognition, and undergraduate courses such as Advanced Programming in Java and Numerical Methods.
